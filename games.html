		<h1> My Favorite Games </h1>
		<p> These are a few of my favorite board games and card games. These games are listed in no particular order. </p>
		<h2> Master Mind </h2>
		<p> Objective of the game: if you're a codemaker, you want to create a clever code so that the decoder can't guess what it is. If you're a decoder, you want to guess the codemaker's code without running out of guesses. </p>
		<h2> UNO </h2>
		<p> Objective of the game: you want to be the first person to get rid of all of their cards. </p>
		<h2> Blokus </h2>
		<p> Objective of the game: you want to put all of your pieces on the board without letting other people's pieces prevent/block you from putting all of your pieces down. </p>
